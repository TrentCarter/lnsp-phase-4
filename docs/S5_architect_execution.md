# S5 Architect Execution Report
_Executed: 2025-09-25T16:00:00Z_

## Summary

Successfully executed all architect-related tasks from the S5 sprint plan. Documented dynamic nlist policy, CPESH two-stage gating, and reinforced CPESH as permanent training data.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Dynamic nlist Policy ✓
**File:** `docs/architecture.md` (Section: Dynamic nlist Policy)

**Key specifications:**
- Added complete `calculate_nlist()` function specification
- Enforces 40× training rule automatically
- Scale-based defaults:
  - <8k vectors: nlist = n_vectors/40
  - 8k-20k vectors: nlist = 200 (for 10k target)
  - 20k-40k vectors: nlist = 512
  - 40k+ vectors: nlist = sqrt(n_vectors)
- Auto-downshift protection prevents under-training

**Cross-reference added:**
- `docs/runtime_env.md` updated with link to dynamic nlist policy

### 2. CPESH Two-Stage Gating Policy ✓
**File:** `docs/architecture.md` (Section: CPESH Two-Stage Gating Policy)

**Documented components:**
- Quality gates (default: quality ≥ 0.82, cosine ≥ 0.55)
- Lane-specific overrides:
  - L1_FACTOID: quality ≥ 0.85 (stricter)
  - L2_NARRATIVE: quality ≥ 0.82 (default)
  - L3_INSTRUCTION: quality ≥ 0.78 (permissive)
- Two-stage search strategy:
  - High-quality CPESH → nprobe=8 (targeted)
  - Low-quality/missing → nprobe=16 (broader)
- Decision logging schema for `artifacts/gating_decisions.jsonl`
- Environment variables for configuration

### 3. CPESH Data Store Clarifications ✓
**Previously updated in S3, reinforced in S5:**
- Emphasized CPESH is permanent training data
- Documented tiered storage architecture
- Specified rotation policies (compress, never delete)
- Added thin wrapper interface specification for future evolution

## Documentation Updates

### Modified Files:
```

### Key Policy Decisions:

1. **Dynamic nlist is mandatory** - No fixed nlist values allowed
2. **CPESH gating is confidence-based** - Poor quality can't degrade results
3. **All decisions are logged** - Full observability for tuning
4. **CPESH data is permanent** - Training corpus, not cache

## Implementation Guidance for Programmer Track

Based on architect specifications, the following modules need implementation:

1. **src/faiss_index.py**
   - Add `calculate_nlist()` function
   - Integrate into build pipeline
   - Emit telemetry with requested vs actual nlist

2. **src/utils/gating.py** (New)
   - `CPESHGateConfig` dataclass
   - `apply_lane()` for overrides
   - `should_use_cpesh()` decision logic

3. **src/datastore/cpesh_store.py** (New)
   - Thin wrapper over JSONL (for now)
   - `append()` and `iter_active()` methods
   - Ready for tiered storage evolution

4. **src/api/retrieve.py**
   - Wire in gating logic
   - Log decisions to JSONL
   - Add `/metrics/gating` endpoint

## Validation Criteria

The architect deliverables are complete when:
- ✓ Dynamic nlist policy prevents under-training
- ✓ CPESH gating prevents quality degradation
- ✓ All decisions are observable via logs
- ✓ CPESH permanence is unambiguous in documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Programmer Track**: Implement code changes per specifications
2. **Consultant Track**: Run A/B sweeps once implementation complete
3. **S6 Planning**: Tiered storage implementation for scale

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Environment variables provide runtime configurability
- Logging infrastructure enables data-driven optimization
- Documentation emphasizes CPESH as training data (3x for clarity)
