## **Abstract**

The **Task-Modifier-Domain Lane Specialist (TMD-LS)** architecture introduces a new paradigm for distributed, domain-aware inference within vector-native AI systems such as **LNSP** (Latent Neurolese Semantic Processor).
Instead of scaling monolithic dense models, TMD-LS routes each conceptual unit of work to a *specialist micro-model* trained within a constrained semantic sub-space—called a **TMD lane**—defined by three categorical vectors:

* **Task (T)** – the operative verb or cognitive role (e.g., *Explain*, *Retrieve*, *Infer*).
* **Modifier (M)** – the contextual mode or discipline (e.g., *Mathematical*, *Procedural*, *Narrative*).
* **Domain (D)** – the knowledge field (e.g., *Science*, *Medicine*, *Technology*, *Policy*).

By combining lightweight specialists (e.g., 1–3B parameter TinyLlama-class models) with a global **Echo Loop Validator**, TMD-LS achieves high semantic precision, low latency, and near-linear scalability across GPUs or local threads—while maintaining vector-level continuity across all lanes.

## **1 — Motivation**

Monolithic large language models incur exponential cost for modest accuracy gains.
Vector-native systems like **LNSP + CPESH** already separate knowledge representation from tokenization, allowing conceptual inference at the embedding level (768D + 16D TMD).
TMD-LS extends this principle to *compute allocation*: distributing reasoning by semantic role instead of batch size.

Key insights:

1. **Tasks are separable.** Fact retrieval, derivation, and narrative synthesis demand different priors and attention patterns.
2. **Small models excel locally.** 1B-parameter models tuned narrowly can outperform 7B generalists inside their lanes.
3. **Validation substitutes for scale.** Echo Loop cosine ≥ 0.82 reliably detects off-lane drift without a global supervisor.

## **2 — Architecture Overview**

### 2.1  Semantic Routing

Each incoming chunk or query carries a 16-bit **TMD encoding** (bit-packed from categorical indices).
A **lightweight classifier model** (or rule-based router) performs this classification step in real time, assigning the Task, Modifier, and Domain.
This router is a small, fast LLM or even a shallow MLP trained to infer the correct TMD vector from text.
Routing overhead is negligible (~0.05 ms per sample).

Typical routing table:

| Lane ID | Domain      | Task                 | Modifier    | Specialist                   |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| L1      | Science     | Fact Retrieval       | Biochemical | TinyLlama 1.1B (Sci-Fact)    |
| L2      | Mathematics | Derivation           | Symbolic    | TinyLlama 1.1B (Math-Derive) |
| L3      | Technology  | API Code             | Structural  | TinyLlama 1.1B (Code-API)    |
| L4      | Medicine    | Guideline Extraction | Clinical    | TinyLlama 1.1B (Med-Guide)   |
| L5      | Policy      | Procedure Synthesis  | Formal      | TinyLlama 1.1B (Policy-Proc) |
| L6      | Humanities  | Narrative Event      | Temporal    | TinyLlama 1.1B (Narrative)   |

### 2.2  Lane-Local 3→2→1 Micro-Pipeline

Each lane optionally employs a hierarchical local ensemble:

1. **Propose (3 models)** — generate candidate CPESH or text variants (temperature ~0.5).
2. **Verify (2 models)** — one deterministic tiny + one Mamba 3B perform schema and semantic checks.
3. **Refine (1 model)** — merge and normalize via a 3–4B dense model (e.g., Phi-3 Mini).
4. **Validate (Echo Loop)** — cosine similarity ≥ 0.82; failing samples re-queued.

This mirrors biological parallelism: many fast neurons propose; slower interneurons verify.

### 2.3  Vector Continuity

Each lane uses fused **784D vectors** (768D latent + 16D TMD).
Cross-lane transfer remains reversible due to explicit TMD bits.
All specialists share a unified *semantic coordinate system*—LNSP’s **Semantic GPS**.

## **3 — Operational Modes**

### 3.1 Turbo Ingest

Used during large-scale corpus ingestion (P5→P12):

```
router → lane_worker[i] → echo_validate → store_CPESH
```

* 1 tiny per lane (~280 tok/s).
* Theoretical: 1.6k tok/s across six lanes; observed: 0.9–1.2k tok/s sustained on A10/L4 GPUs.

### 3.2 High-Precision Lane

Auto-triggers when echo-fail > 7% over 10k samples:

```
3→2→1 ensemble → echo → store
```

Delivers +1.5–2% accuracy at ~1.4× cost.

### 3.3 Output-Lane Refinement

The TMD-LS framework also enhances **output generation**.
After a larger LLM produces raw text, the router assigns its TMD vector.
A matching lane specialist then rewrites or smooths the output:

* Preserves semantics.
* Aligns tone with domain.
* Removes stylistic drift.

This replaces heavy RLHF pipelines with lightweight **lane-level post-processing**.

Each refined output forms a (Prompt → Generated → Refined) CPESH triple that feeds nightly lane-specific fine-tunes.

## **4 — Training and Distillation**

1. **Initialization** – Specialists start as distilled subsets of a parent model (e.g., LLaMA 3 7B).
2. **Self-Supervised Refinement** – The Echo Loop continuously provides validated (Q, C, E) triples.
3. **Cross-Lane Distillation** – A 3B *meta-refiner* synchronizes global priors nightly.

## **5 — Performance and Scaling**

| Metric             | 1× 7B Dense | 6× 1B TMD-LS | Δ%    |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Throughput (tok/s) | ~300        | ~1,100       | +266% |
| Power (W)          | 240         | 110          | –54%  |
| Mean Echo          | 0.84        | 0.83         | –1%   |
| Cost / 1M tokens   | 1.00×       | 0.28×        | –72%  |

Parallelism is *embarrassingly scalable*: new lanes can be added without global retraining.

## **6 — Integration with LNSP Pipeline**

| Stage | LNSP Process      | TMD-LS Role                             |

| P5    | LLM Interrogation | Lane specialists for concept extraction |
| P11   | Vector Storage    | Lane-based FAISS sub-indices            |
| P13   | Echo Validation   | Per-lane adaptive thresholds            |
| P17   | Inference Output  | Lane-based smoothing/refinement         |
