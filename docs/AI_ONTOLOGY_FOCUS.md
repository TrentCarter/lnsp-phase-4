# AI/ML Ontology Focus (No Biology)

## Decision: 2025-10-05

**Removed from LNSP**:
- ❌ Gene Ontology (GO): 170K biological concepts - not relevant to AI/ML

**Keeping**:
- ✅ Software Ontology (SWO): 2,013 concepts
  - Software tools, algorithms, methods
  - "R software", "data transformation", "M-estimation regression"
  
- ✅ DBpedia: 484 concepts  
  - General knowledge graph
  - Mix of topics (filter AI/ML-related later)

**To Add** (future):
- Machine Learning Ontology (MLO)
- Deep Learning concepts
- NLP terminology
- Computer Science concepts

**Target Size**: ~3-5K AI/ML-focused concepts (vs 173K with biology)
