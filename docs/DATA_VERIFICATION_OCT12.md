## üóÑÔ∏è Database Locations

### PostgreSQL (lnsp database)

**Table: `cpe_entry`** (metadata)
```sql
SELECT cpe_id, concept_text, tmd_bits, domain_code, task_code, modifier_code
FROM cpe_entry
WHERE dataset_source = 'user_input';
```

**Table: `cpe_vectors`** (embeddings)
```sql
SELECT v.cpe_id, v.concept_vec, v.tmd_vec
FROM cpe_vectors v
JOIN cpe_entry e ON v.cpe_id = e.cpe_id
WHERE e.dataset_source = 'user_input';
```
