# S1 Architect Deliverables Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Timestamp Schema Policy Frozen

**Created `docs/timestamps.md`** with comprehensive timestamp policy:
- **Core Principle**: Indefinite retention with no auto-expiration
- **Required Fields**: `created_at`, `last_accessed` (ISO8601 format)
- **Optional Fields**: `modified_at`, `access_count`, `last_modified_by`

**Layer-specific implementations defined:**
- **PostgreSQL**: TIMESTAMPTZ columns with indexes
- **FAISS**: Companion metadata structures
- **Neo4j**: Node and relationship timestamps
- **JSONL Cache**: Full timestamp + access_count tracking

**Bit-packing rules included:**
- 32-bit epoch seconds for compact storage
- 16-bit relative timestamps for access patterns
- Migration strategy for legacy entries

### 2. Architecture.md Updated

**Removed all references to 7-day TTL** - confirmed indefinite retention

**Enhanced CPESH Cache Policy section:**
- Added `access_count` to cache format
- Cross-referenced to `docs/timestamps.md`
- Documented manual pruning rules explicitly

**Manual Pruning Rules documented:**
- Quality-based: Remove low-quality entries (score < 0.5)
- Usage-based: Archive entries not accessed in 90+ days
- Curation-based: Domain expert selective removal
- No automatic deletion - all pruning requires explicit action
- Audit trail requirement for all pruning operations

### 3. No Cloud Fallback Confirmed

**Verified in architecture.md:**
- Local LLM only (no external APIs)
- Enforcement via `LocalLlamaClient`
- Failures return empty CPESH, never fall back to cloud

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Timestamp Format**: ISO8601 UTC for all timestamps
2. **Retention Policy**: Indefinite (no TTL, no auto-expiration)
3. **Pruning Strategy**: Manual only, based on quality/usage/curation
4. **Migration Path**: Auto-migrate missing timestamps on first access
5. **Performance**: Bit-packing available for high-volume scenarios

## Schema Updates Already Applied

Noted that `src/schemas.py` was already updated with:
```python
class CPESH(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    created_at: Optional[str] = None  # ISO8601 timestamp
    last_accessed: Optional[str] = None  # ISO8601 timestamp
```

## Cross-Layer Consistency

Ensured timestamp policy is consistent across:
- Text DB (PostgreSQL with TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Vector DB (FAISS with companion metadata)
- Graph DB (Neo4j with datetime properties)
- File Cache (JSONL with ISO8601 strings)

## Documentation Hierarchy

1. **`docs/architecture.md`** - High-level policy and configuration
2. **`docs/timestamps.md`** - Detailed implementation guide
3. **`docs/timestamp_implementation_impact.md`** - Migration impact analysis

## Next Steps (For Programmer Role)

Based on the frozen schema:
1. Implement `src/utils/timestamps.py` with utility functions
2. Update `src/api/retrieve.py` to handle timestamps on cache operations
3. Extend JSONL cache format with timestamps
4. Ensure backward compatibility for entries without timestamps

## Validation Points

- ✅ No 7-day TTL anywhere in the system
- ✅ Manual pruning rules clearly defined
- ✅ ISO8601 format standardized across layers
- ✅ Bit-packing rules documented for future optimization
- ✅ Migration strategy defined for legacy data
