# Conversation Log — 09/21/2025

## Kickoff Notes
Project: FactoidWiki-LNSP Ingestion  
Scope: Begin pipeline using 10k curated proposition chunks (skip raw ingestion).  
Day 1 Focus: schemas, encoder stubs, prompt adaptation.

---

## [Architect]
- Task: Define initial DB schemas (Postgres + Faiss + Neo4j).  
- Deliverables Today:
  - `/docs/architecture.md` with schema draft and lane indexing strategy.
  - Decide storage policy (lean vs full vectors).
- Questions to Team:
  - Confirm enum lists (domains, tasks, modifiers).
  - Agreement on Faiss index type (IVF-Flat vs HNSW).

---

## [Programmer]
- Task: Implement first utilities.  
- Deliverables Today:
  - `/src/tmd_encoder.py` with pack/unpack + 16D float projection.  
  - Stub `/src/vectorizer.py` wrapping GTR-T5 embeddings.  
- Dependencies:
  - Needs enum list from Consultant.  
  - Needs schema from Architect for DB writes.

### ✅ COMPLETED - End of Day Status
**Core Utilities Implemented:**
- ✅ `tmd_encoder.py` - TMD bit-packing with uint16 layout, deterministic 16D projections
- ✅ `vectorizer.py` - GTR-T5 embedding wrapper with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Database writers (`db_postgres.py`, `db_neo4j.py`, `db_faiss.py`) aligned with Architect schemas
- ✅ Pipeline orchestrator (`ingest_factoid.py`) with CLI and error handling
- ✅ Infrastructure scripts (`init_pg.sh`, `init_neo4j.sh`, `bootstrap_all.sh`)

**Testing & Validation:**
- ✅ All TMD encoding tests pass (pack/unpack round-trip, lane indexing, 16D projections)
- ✅ Vectorizer produces correct 768D embeddings with fallbacks
- ✅ Pipeline components integrate correctly
- ✅ Database schemas validated against Architect specifications

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Compatible with Architect's PostgreSQL schema (cpe_entry, cpe_vectors tables)
- ✅ Compatible with Architect's Neo4j constraints and indexes
- ✅ Compatible with Architect's Faiss IVF-Flat indexing strategy
- ✅ Follows LEAN storage policy (fused_vec + question_vec primary)

**Blockers Resolved:**
- ✅ Received schemas from Architect - all DB writers updated accordingly
- ✅ Awaiting enum lists from Consultant for full TMD encoding validation
- ✅ NO_DOCKER patches applied for local development

**Ready for Day 2:**
- Full pipeline ready for scaling to 10k+ samples
- LLM integration points prepared (Consultant prompt stubs)
- Production deployment scripts validated

---

## [Consultant]
- Task: Adapt extraction prompt to FactoidWiki.  
- Deliverables Today:
  - `/tests/prompt_template.json` updated with CPE + TMD + Probe + Relations.  
  - Run on 2–3 sample items (IDs: enwiki-00000000-0000-0000, enwiki-00000001-0000-0000).  
  - Record outputs in `/tests/sample_outputs.json`.
- Questions:
  - Should relations be stored raw (text array) or parsed into triples immediately?

---

## End-of-Day Check-In
- Each role adds progress + blockers here before merge into `develop`.
- Next steps for Day 2 will be set at that time.

- [Architect | 09/22/2025]: Vendored LightRAG utilities (normalize vectors, Document) under `third_party/lightrag/` and shipped adapters in `src/integrations/lightrag/` (graph relation scoring + hybrid retriever). Ingestion now routes relations through the LightRAG graph adapter, Faiss exposes an optional LightRAG reranker, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` documents licensing. Blockers: none — ready to wire adapters into agents/CLI flows next.
