## 🎯 Expected Results

Based on Phase-2 context scaling (500-ctx → 66.52% Hit@5):

| Metric | Phase-2 (500-ctx) | Phase-3 Target (1000-ctx) | Expected Gain |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Hit@5** | 66.52% | **69-71%** | **+3-5%** |
| **Hit@10** | 74.78% | **78-80%** | **+3-5%** |
| **Hit@1** | 50.00% | **53-55%** | **+3-5%** |

**Rationale**:
- Phase-1 → Phase-2: 5x context → +7.20% Hit@5 (+12% relative)
- Phase-2 → Phase-3: 2x context → expected +3-5% Hit@5 (linear scaling)

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

**Estimated training time**: ~45-60 minutes

**Why longer than Phase-2?**
- 2x context size (1000 vs 500 vectors)
- Slightly fewer sequences (1,146 vs 2,295) but larger memory footprint
- Each forward pass processes 2x data per sequence

**Completion ETA**: ~8:45-9:00 PM (Oct 19)

## 📈 Why Phase-3 (Skip Phase-2C)?

**Phase-2B Result**: InfoNCE tuning (α 0.03 → 0.05) = **+0.00% gain**

**Key learnings**:
1. **Contrastive learning has plateaued** at 500-context
   - Model already separates positives/negatives optimally
   - Higher α won't improve discriminative power

2. **Context scaling is the proven lever**
   - Phase-1 → Phase-2: 5x context = +7.20% Hit@5
   - Consistent, reliable gains

3. **Hard negatives (Phase-2C) too risky**
   - Expected gain: +1-2% at best
   - Risk: Might hurt Hit@5 while chasing Hit@10
   - Opportunity cost: Context scaling has higher ROI

**Decision**: Skip Phase-2C entirely, proceed to Phase-3

## 🎓 Training Evolution Summary

| Phase | Context | Hit@5 | Change | Method |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Broken | 100 vec | 36.99% | Baseline | (degraded) |
| **Phase-1** | 100 vec | **59.32%** | **+22.33%** | Consultant's 4 fixes |
| **Phase-2** | 500 vec | **66.52%** | **+7.20%** | Context scaling (5x) |
| Phase-2B | 500 vec | 66.52% | +0.00% | ❌ InfoNCE tuning |
| **Phase-3** 🔄 | 1000 vec | **69-71%** (target) | **+3-5%** (expected) | Context scaling (2x) |

**Total expected improvement**: 36.99% → 69-71% = **+32-34% absolute** (+88-92% relative!)

## 🚨 Latency Considerations

**Expected latency increase**:
- Phase-2 (500-ctx): ~2.5ms per query
- Phase-3 (1000-ctx): **~5ms per query** (2x context → 2x compute)

**Canary guardrail**: P95 latency ≤ +20% (≤3ms from Phase-2 baseline)
- If Phase-3 latency > 3ms: Consider context-based routing
  - Short queries (<5K tokens): Use Phase-2 (2.5ms)
  - Long queries (5K-20K tokens): Use Phase-3 (5ms)

**Production deployment strategy**:
1. Measure actual Phase-3 latency on canary traffic (5%)
2. If latency acceptable: Gradual rollout (5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
3. If latency too high: Implement hybrid routing (Phase-2 + Phase-3)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase-3 is considered successful if**:
1. ✅ Hit@5 ≥ 68.0% (minimum +1.5% over Phase-2)
2. ✅ Hit@10 ≥ 76.0% (minimum +1.2% over Phase-2)
3. ✅ Training converges without instability
4. 🟡 Latency ≤ 5ms P95 (acceptable for high-value queries)

**If successful**: Deploy to production canary (5% traffic)

**If latency too high**: Implement context-based routing:
- Phase-2 for queries with <2500 context vectors
- Phase-3 for queries with 2500-5000 context vectors

---

## 📊 Next Steps After Phase-3

**If Phase-3 achieves 69-71% Hit@5**:

### Option A: Production Canary Deployment
- Deploy Phase-3 to 5% traffic
- Monitor Hit@K proxy, latency, error rates
- Gradual rollout if metrics green

### Option B: Phase-4 (TMD Routing)
- 16 specialist experts (one per TMD lane)
- Lane-aware routing with gating
- Expected: +2-3% Hit@5 → **72-74% Hit@5**
- Target: **75%+ Hit@5** (ultimate goal!)

### Option C: Architectural Improvements
- Hierarchical caching (5×200 chunks for 1000-ctx)
- Gradient checkpointing (reduce memory)
- Mixed precision training (faster convergence)

**Recommendation**: Start with canary deployment to validate real-world performance, then pursue TMD routing for final push to 75%+.

## 🔍 Current System Status (7:57 PM)

**Running**:
- ✅ Phase-3 training (PID 51519) - 1000-vector context

- ✅ Phase-2: 66.52% Hit@5 (500-ctx)
- ✅ Phase-2B: 66.52% Hit@5 (α tuning - no gain)
- ✅ Phase-3 data export: 3.3 GB ready

**Next**:
- Wait for Phase-3 results (~45-60 min)
- Analyze performance vs. latency trade-off
- Decide on canary deployment or next phase

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**We're testing the hypothesis that context scaling (not contrastive tuning) is the path to 70%+ Hit@5. Phase-2B gave us +0%, now we're betting on Phase-3's 2x context to deliver +3-5%.** 🎯

**If this works, we'll have proven that capacity (context length) is more valuable than complexity (hard negatives, architectural changes) for LVM performance.** 🚀

**Partner, Phase-3 is training! We skipped the dead-end (Phase-2C) and went straight for the proven lever (context scaling). Let's see if 1000-vector context breaks us through to 70%!** ✨
