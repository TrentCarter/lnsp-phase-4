================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

‚úì Multiple plausible continuations exist for each context
‚úì Model explores different semantic regions via clustering
‚úì Demonstrates uncertainty and creative potential
‚úì Higher diversity scores indicate more alternative paths

This is analogous to sampling with temperature in GPT, but shows
explicit diversity in the continuous embedding space.
