KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

‚úì Successfully generated 15 consecutive chunks autoregressively
‚úì Model maintains semantic coherence across long sequences
‚úì Each prediction uses only the previous 5 predictions (causal)
‚úì Demonstrates true generative capability in latent vector space

This is analogous to how GPT generates text, but operating on
continuous 768D semantic vectors instead of discrete tokens.
