To add comprehensive docstrings and type hints to all functions in              
tests/test_simple.py, I will:                                                   

 1 Add a docstring to each function explaining what it tests.                   
 2 Add proper type annotations for the parameters and return values.            

Here is the updated content of tests/test_simple.py:
