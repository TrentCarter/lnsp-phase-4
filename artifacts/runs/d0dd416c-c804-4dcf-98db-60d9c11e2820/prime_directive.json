  "goal": "Ensure FAISS index is properly saved to disk after ingestion completes. Currently, vectors are built in memory but faiss_db.save() is never called, causing data loss on restart. Success criteria: (1) FAISS index file exists in artifacts/ after ingestion, (2) Retrieval API can load index after restart, (3) New test verifies save() is called, (4) All existing tests pass.",
