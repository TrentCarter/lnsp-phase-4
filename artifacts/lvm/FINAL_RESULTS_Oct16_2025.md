## 🔬 What Changed from InfoNCE Failure?

**Previous (InfoNCE Loss):**
- Transformer: 0.3539 (20 epochs) ❌
- 35% worse than baseline
- Wrong optimization objective

**Now (MSE Loss):**
- Transformer: 0.5817 (20 epochs) ✅
- 6.5% better than baseline
- Correct optimization objective
- **Improvement: +64%!**

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Loss Function is Critical**
   - MSE directly optimizes what we care about (vector prediction)
   - InfoNCE optimizes contrastive task (wrong for this problem)

2. **All Architectures Work**
   - LSTM, GRU, Transformer, AMN all beat baseline
   - Architecture choice depends on requirements (speed vs accuracy)

3. **Residual Learning Helps**
   - AMN's residual design gives interpretability
   - But larger models can learn implicitly

4. **Bigger ≠ Always Better**
   - AMN (1.5M) vs Transformer (17.9M) = 10x params for +2.7% gain
   - Diminishing returns on model size

5. **Training is Stable**
   - All models converged smoothly
   - No mode collapse (previous issue with wrong embeddings)
   - Real vec2text-compatible vectors work!

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Production (LNSP):
**Choose: LSTM (0.5713)**
- Best balance of performance and efficiency
- Fast inference (<1ms per prediction)
- Small memory footprint
- Easy to deploy

### For Maximum Accuracy:
**Choose: Transformer (0.5817)**
- Best absolute performance
- Worth the extra compute if accuracy is critical

### For Research/Interpretability:
**Choose: AMN (0.5664)**
- Most parameter-efficient
- Attention weights are interpretable
- Novel architecture worth studying

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Test on held-out 20% (16k vectors)
2. Visualize attention weights (AMN)
3. Error analysis (where do models fail?)

### Short-Term:
4. Try longer training (30-50 epochs)
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Ensemble methods

### Long-Term:
7. Deploy best model for LNSP vecRAG
8. Multi-hop prediction (predict t+5)
9. Conditional generation (query-based prediction)
