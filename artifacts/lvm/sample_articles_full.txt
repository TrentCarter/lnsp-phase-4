       6942 | Russian Orthodox bell ringing          |         100 |          17 | Originally, a flat piece of wood or metal called a semantron would be beaten rhythmically with a mallet to summon the faithful to services.                                                              | 5d051f5f-c179-4298-b55c-be131882ce0b
