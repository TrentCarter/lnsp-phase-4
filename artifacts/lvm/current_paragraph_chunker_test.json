      "However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high- stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM- based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task."

      "Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several po- tential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping."
