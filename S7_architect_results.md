# S7 "Cleanup & Test" Pack - Architect Results

## Execution Summary
Successfully completed all [architect] tasks from conversation_09252025_S7.md:

### ✅ Task 1: Quick repo hygiene (copy/paste)
- **Makefile**: Added `smoketest` target to `.PHONY` and created target that runs `scripts/s7_smoketest.sh`
- **New script**: Created `scripts/s7_smoketest.sh` with executable permissions
  - Validates artifacts/index_meta.json structure
  - Checks gating_decisions.jsonl existence and content
  - Tests API health endpoints (/health/faiss, /metrics/gating)
  - Optional search endpoint test when LNSP_EMBEDDER_PATH is set
  - Appends runtime info to artifacts/runtime.lock
  - Returns pass/fail summary and appropriate exit codes

### ✅ Task 2: One minimal pytest to guard the wiring
- **New file**: Created `tests/test_pipeline_smoke.py`
  - `test_index_meta_keys()`: Validates artifacts/index_meta.json structure
  - `test_gating_metrics_endpoint()`: Tests /metrics/gating endpoint (requires S7_API_URL env var)
  - Uses pytest.mark.skipif for optional API tests

### ✅ Task 3: Single-page "today wrap" you can commit
- **New doc**: Created `docs/S7_day_wrap_2025-09-25.md`
  - Documents current working features (dynamic nlist, CPESH gating, metrics)
  - 10k retrieval status with index specs and performance metrics
  - CPESH datastore architecture (permanent tiered approach)
  - Pipeline map showing solid/operational/R&D components
  - Today's artifacts listing
  - Risk items and S8 targets

## Key Deliverables Created:
1. `Makefile` - Added smoketest target
2. `scripts/s7_smoketest.sh` - Comprehensive system validation script
3. `tests/test_pipeline_smoke.py` - Minimal pytest guards
4. `docs/S7_day_wrap_2025-09-25.md` - Day wrap documentation

## Usage Instructions:

### Run smoketest (with API running):
```bash
# Start API first
make api PORT=8092

# Run smoketest
make smoketest PORT=8092
# or: PORT=8093 make smoketest
```

### Run pytest:
```bash
# Basic test
pytest -q

# With API checks
S7_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8092 pytest -q
```

## Big Picture Alignment:
The system now matches the pipeline intent: CPESH is permanent, tiered training data; vector retrieval is lane-routed; index sizing is dynamic; CPESH is a confidence-gated accelerator, not a mandatory step. This keeps today's 10k local run consistent with the 10M→10B scale path described in your PRD.

## Runbook to close S7 (3 commands):
```bash
# 1) Ensure API is up (pick a free port)
make api PORT=8092

# 2) One-shot smoketest (validates meta, endpoints, decisions file, runtime lock)
make smoketest PORT=8092

# 3) (Optional) pytest with live API checks
S7_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8092 pytest -q
```
