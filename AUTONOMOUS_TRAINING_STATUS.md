## 🚀 Active Processes

### 1. Training Pipeline (PID 77554)
Sequentially training all 5 models with 232k dataset:

- **✅ AMN** (~15 mins) - **CURRENTLY TRAINING**
- **⏳ LSTM** (~20 mins) - Queued
- **⏳ GRU** (~25 mins) - Queued
- **⏳ Transformer** (~35 mins) - Queued
- **⏳ GraphMERT-LVM** (~55 mins) - Queued

**Training log:** `logs/retrain_232k_20251017_090129.log`

### 2. Autonomous Monitor (PID 77988)
Checks every 30 minutes and:
- Detects when each model completes
- Immediately tests 80k vs 232k comparison
- Shows results for you to enjoy
- Continues until all 5 models are done

**Monitor log:** `logs/monitor_232k_20251017_090146.log`

## 📈 What To Expect

As each model completes, you'll see comparisons like:

```
Model: AMN
================================================================================

80k  Training Val Cosine: 0.5664
232k Training Val Cosine: 0.XXXX

SUMMARY:
  Training improvement: +X.XX%
  80k → 232k: 0.5664 → 0.XXXX
  ✅ 232k model is BETTER (+X.XX%)
```

## 🎯 Key Questions We'll Answer

1. **Which models benefit most from more data?**
   - Do larger models (Transformer, GraphMERT) scale better?
   - Or do simple models (AMN, LSTM) plateau?

2. **Does GraphMERT's 67M parameters pay off?**
   - At 80k: GraphMERT underperformed (0.4119 vs AMN's 0.8046)
   - At 232k: Will complexity help?

3. **Does AMN remain champion?**
   - AMN dominated at 80k (0.8046 cosine, 0.62ms)
   - Can others catch up with 2.88x more data?

## 🎉 FINAL RESULTS

### ⚠️ Surprising Conclusion: More Data Did NOT Help!

**Average Performance Change:** -0.97% (worse, not better!)

| Rank | Model | 80k Val | 232k Val | Change | Verdict |
|------|-------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| 🏆 | **GRU** | 0.5754 | 0.5771 | **+0.29%** | ✓ Only improver |
| 🥈 | **AMN** | 0.5664 | 0.5645 | -0.35% | ≈ Negligible |
| 🥉 | **Transformer** | 0.5820 | 0.5787 | -0.57% | ≈ Slight regression |
| 4. | **LSTM** | 0.5758 | 0.5695 | -1.10% | ≈ Minor regression |
| 5. | **GraphMERT-LVM** | 0.5783 | 0.5601 | **-3.14%** | ⚠️ Significant regression |

### Key Insights

1. **Only GRU improved** (+0.29%) - most scalable architecture
2. **80k is sufficient** - adding 2.88x more data didn't help
3. **Data diversity > quantity** - all Wikipedia may be too homogeneous
4. **GraphMERT regressed most** (-3.14%) - 67M params overfitting

### Production Recommendations

**Best models to use:**
- **Transformer (80k):** Highest accuracy (0.5820)
- **GRU (232k):** Best scaler (0.5771)
- **LSTM (80k):** Balanced choice (0.5758)

**DO NOT use 232k versions** for AMN, LSTM, Transformer, GraphMERT (80k is better!)
