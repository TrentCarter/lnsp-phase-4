# Test 1: Single Concept (Photosynthesis)
TEXT_1_CONCEPT = """
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During photosynthesis, plants absorb
light energy through chlorophyll molecules. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide
and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose serves as food for the plant, while oxygen
is released as a byproduct.
"""

# Test 2: Two Concepts (Photosynthesis + Cellular Respiration)
TEXT_2_CONCEPTS = """
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During photosynthesis, plants absorb
light energy through chlorophyll molecules. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide
and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose serves as food for the plant.

Cellular respiration is the metabolic process that converts glucose into ATP energy.
This process occurs in the mitochondria of cells. During cellular respiration, glucose
is broken down through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.
Oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. This process
provides energy for all cellular activities.
"""

# Test 3: Three Concepts (Photosynthesis + Cellular Respiration + Fermentation)
TEXT_3_CONCEPTS = """
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During photosynthesis, plants absorb
light energy through chlorophyll molecules. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide
and water into glucose and oxygen.

Cellular respiration is the metabolic process that converts glucose into ATP energy.
This process occurs in the mitochondria of cells. During cellular respiration, glucose
is broken down through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.
Oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product.

Fermentation is an anaerobic process that allows cells to produce energy without oxygen.
In alcoholic fermentation, yeast converts glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
In lactic acid fermentation, muscle cells convert glucose into lactic acid during
intense exercise. This process produces less ATP than cellular respiration but can
occur when oxygen is limited.
