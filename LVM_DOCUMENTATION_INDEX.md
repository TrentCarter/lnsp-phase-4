## 🔑 Key Takeaways (From All Documents)

### The 4 Critical Fixes (Never Forget!)

1. **Early Stopping on Hit@5** ✅
   - Monitor task-specific metric (not loss!)
   - Patience=3 is the sweet spot
   - Preserved +14% Hit@5 from degradation

2. **L2-Normalization Before Losses** ✅
   - Normalize BEFORE computing losses
   - Critical for delta prediction
   - +8% improvement from proper placement

3. **Loss Balance** ✅
   - InfoNCE: 0.05 (Phase 1), 0.03 (Phase 2)
   - Effective batch: 256 (gradient accumulation)
   - LR: 1e-4 (reduced from 5e-4)

4. **Quality Gates** ✅
   - Chain-level split (0 leakage)
   - Coherence filtering (but not too strict!)
   - Maximum data utilization

### Key Learnings

1. **Hit@K > Cosine** for retrieval tasks
   - Would have deployed broken model (59% cosine, 3% Hit@5)
   - Always evaluate on task-specific metrics

2. **Context Scaling Works**
   - 5x context → +7% Hit@5 (near-linear!)
   - Can potentially scale to 1000+ vectors

3. **Training Hygiene > Architecture**
   - Same model: 59% vs 37% (different training)
   - Recipe matters more than complexity

4. **Early Stopping Is Gold**
   - Caught peak performance at epoch 22
   - Prevented degradation to 56%
